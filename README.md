Data visualization in Tableau

This project demonstrates how 3-dimentional bubble charts can misrepresent the data.

The image on the left creates an illusion that grey disks comprise about 40% of all items.
The image on the right makes it seem more like 80%.
None of that is true. 

Meanwhile, a simpler bubble plot (bottom) stays true to the data

Wish I took better screenshots before my 14 days Tableau Desktop trial expired.
